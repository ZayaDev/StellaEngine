# StellaEngine

Hello! Zaya here, this is the Stella Engine repository, an engine under development that in the future will allow you to create 2d games using the Lua programming language.
The Stella Engine is a project created by me, Zaya, but it would not be viable without the great help of UnknownBeast.
